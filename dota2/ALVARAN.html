			I've been playing this game for 6 years. Almost everyday i am playing 2-5 games. Sometimes me and my friends are playing it. It's fun when we are doing LAN (local area network) matches. This is the time when we are in high school. After class we are rushing in to the nearest computer renting shop. Lots of laughs and of course trashtalking to each other. Those memories will last forever.
